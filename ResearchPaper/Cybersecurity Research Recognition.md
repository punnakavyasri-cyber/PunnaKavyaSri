# ðŸ“– Research Project â€“ AI for SQL Injection Detection

**Title:** *An Exploratory Study on the Effectiveness of AI Algorithms for SQLIA in Web Applications*

**Recognition:** Received **Honorable Mention** at the 48th Annual Gannon University Writing Awards Night (2025)

**Overview:** <br>
This research explored how **SQL Injection Attacks (SQLIA)** remain one of the most persistent threats in web applications, targeting vulnerabilities in database queries to gain unauthorized access or manipulate sensitive data. While traditional defenses such as input validation and signature-based detection effectively counter known attacks, they often fail to recognize new or evolving SQL injection techniques. This security gap motivated an investigation into how **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)** could provide more adaptive and reliable protection.  
  
The study reviewed commonly applied ML models for SQLIA detection with special focus on underutilized but promising approaches. By comparing different AI techniques, the research demonstrated how intelligent models can strengthen defensive strategies by identifying patterns that conventional methods miss. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions in cybersecurity, particularly in advancing **AI-driven defenses** that enhance web application resilience against real-time threats. 

**Impact:** This recognition highlighted the significance of applying AI to enhance web application security and validated the work's contribution to the academic and cybersecurity community

**Future Plans:** Expanding findings for formal publication in peer-reviewed journals
